## Unit1 : Kotlin Basics



### Pathway3:Create a Birthday Card app



* Set up your Happy Birthday app

  * Create an empty activity template

  * (!) YOU have to check the PACKAGE NAME(!)

  * UI 

    -  ``  View``  

      -the elements in UI which you can see on the screen

      ex) an image, a clickable button, text on the screen

      -to organize `Views`, you put them in a container

      -this container is called ``ViewGroup`` responsible for arranging the View objects within it.

      

    - TextView 

      -UI element for displaying text in your app.

    

    - Layout Editor

      -It helps you create the UI

      

    - Constraint Layout

      -the type of ViewGroup that helps you arrange the views inside of it in a flexible way

      

    - Attributes in Android

      -text, textSize, textColor

      

    - Drawable

      -a graphic that can be drawn to the screen

      

    - Example of "constraint" that is applied to a view in a ConstraintLayout Viewgroup in the Layout editor

      -a view that must always be a minimum distance away from edge of its container(this can be marginal constraint)

      -a view that must always be to the right of another view

      -a view that must always be the topmost view inside a container

      

    - Purpose of the activity_main.xml file

      -It describes the layout of view groups and views for a screen

      

    - Necessity of using string resources instead of hard coding strings

      -It makes your app easier to translate

      -It allows you to reuse the same string in multiple places in your program
