### Pathway4: Add a button to an app





* Class : Information about properties shared by all "things" belonging to the class, such as number of sides, number of legs, or that it has a color.

  - Example of a class
    - A Car class that has a make and model, and that can be driven
    - A Flower class that has a scent
    - A Puppy class that has breed, weight and age, and that can bark
    - A ShoppingCart class that has a cart size and cart value, and that holds items
    - A Song class that has lyrics.

  

* Instance : The specifics about a property, such as the specific color of a "thing" that can have a color.

  

* Kotlin data type

  ex) IntRange, Int , Boolean

  

* Difference between Class and Instance to use the examples

  - Class as a blueprint, instance as  the actual "thing"

  - Class as an architectural plans for a bridge, and the Golden Gate bridge an instance of those plans

  - You can create multiple instances from a class,but impossible for vice versa.

    

* Every MainActivity class in Android do not  necessarily have a main() function.

  

* The way for creating a comment in Kotlin

  - Add // at the beginning of or inside a line and anything after that // is considered as a comment.

  - Put /* or /** to start a block comment, and end it with */.

    

* Reason for you to add comments

  - To explain why the code is written a certain way.
  - To structure code, like chapter headings in books.
  - To point out some part of the code that is very important.
  - To explain to other developers how to use your code for their own programs.

  

* Conditional statement

  - a way for you to set up a condition and ensure that code following it is only executed if that condition is met.

  - It can be used within functions to return output  based on conditions defined in that function.

  - key words

    - if, else

    -  when
